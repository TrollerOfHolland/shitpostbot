# Shitpost Selfbot


A discord self-bot to automate shitposting for your everyday needs. Caution: May be a little racist.

I have no clue where we are taking this thing. It's just there for the sake of being there.

# Usage
!!! READ THE CODE FOR YOURSELF !!!

!!! DON'T BLINDLY TRUST PEOPLE !!!

The obvious out of the way, you will have to `python -m pip install [library name]` for any libraries you may be missing.

Afterwards, open the `config.py` file, and enter your token and ID.
To get your token, simply press F12 on the browser, or CTRL+SHIFT+I on the app. Tab over to networking, and keep clicking packets until you find one with the `Authorization` key.

For the ID, simply go into Settings -> Advanced -> Enable developer mode, then right-click yourself and Copy ID.
